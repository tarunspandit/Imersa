# LIFX.py Fixes Applied

## Summary of fixes applied to lifx.py:

### 1. Wide Tile Fix (Line 472 - _fallback_to_tile_colors function)
Applied the 16×8 wide tile fix from ceiling_split_set64_test.py that sends multiple Set64 messages with x offsets for tiles wider than 8 zones.

### 2. Fixed undefined _set_color_rgb function (Line 1336)
Replaced the undefined function call with direct RGB to HSBK conversion and device.set_color() call.

### 3. Removed duplicate elif statement (Lines 1749-1751)
Removed the duplicate elif hasattr(device, 'set_tile_colors') check.

### 4. Removed duplicate keepalive registration (Lines 435-437)
Removed duplicate "Start keep-alive thread if not running" block.

## All fixes have been successfully applied to the lifx.py file

The main fix enables proper gradient support for the LIFX Ceiling 13×26 (which reports as 16×8) by splitting the color data into two Set64 messages with x offsets of 0 and 8, exactly as proven in the ceiling_split_set64_test.py test file.
