# LIFX Discovery Fix - Devices Found But Not Added

## Problem
- Discovery was finding 8 LIFX devices on the network
- But reporting "Added 0 device(s)" - none were actually being added to the bridge
- Devices at IPs: 192.168.1.42, .27, .77, .186, .195, .182, .231, .237

## Root Cause
**Critical Bug**: The variable `product_id` was being used without being defined, causing a NameError exception that was silently caught.

### The Bug
```python
# BEFORE - product_id is never defined!
protocol_cfg = {
    "ip": ip,
    "id": mac,
    "label": label,
    "product_name": product_name,
    "product_id": product_id  # NameError: name 'product_id' is not defined
}
```

This error was happening in the `try` block, so it would jump to:
```python
except Exception as e:
    logging.debug(f"LIFX: Error processing device: {e}")  # Too quiet!
    continue
```

## Fix Applied

### 1. Get product_id before using it
```python
# AFTER - Properly retrieve product_id
if not already_exists:
    # Get product ID from device
    try:
        product_id = device.get_product()
    except:
        product_id = None
    
    # Now safe to use product_id
    protocol_cfg = {
        "ip": ip,
        "id": mac,
        "label": label,
        "product_name": product_name,
        "product_id": product_id  # Now properly defined
    }
```

### 2. Better error logging
```python
# BEFORE - Silent failure
except Exception as e:
    logging.debug(f"LIFX: Error processing device: {e}")
    continue

# AFTER - Visible errors with full traceback
except Exception as e:
    logging.error(f"LIFX: Error processing device at {ip}: {e}")
    import traceback
    logging.debug(f"LIFX: Traceback: {traceback.format_exc()}")
    continue
```

### 3. Device validation
```python
# Validate device object has required methods
if not hasattr(device, 'get_ip_addr') or not hasattr(device, 'get_mac_addr'):
    logging.warning(f"LIFX: Skipping invalid device object: {type(device)}")
    continue

# Skip if we couldn't get basic info
if not ip or not mac:
    logging.warning(f"LIFX: Skipping device with missing IP or MAC")
    continue
```

## Testing
Run the test script to verify discovery now works:
```bash
python tests/test_lifx_discovery.py
```

## Expected Result
- All 8 devices should now be properly added
- Each device will have its product_id stored
- Matrix devices (Candle, Tube, etc.) will be properly identified
- Error messages will be visible if any device fails to add

## Impact
This fix resolves:
- ✅ Devices not being added during discovery
- ✅ Silent failures hiding the real error
- ✅ Missing product_id preventing proper device type detection
- ✅ Matrix devices not being identified correctly

## Prevention
- Always define variables before use
- Use ERROR level logging for failures that prevent functionality
- Include traceback information in debug logs
- Validate objects before using their methods
